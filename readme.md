Overview
- Weeds grow up from the ground and roots grow deep / wide underground
- Player needs to remove as many weeds as possible before the all reach the top of the screen
- The player can pull weeds out using button 1
- Weeds that reach the top of the screen can't be pulled out at all
- Weeds with long roots are harder to pull out
- Score accumulates based on size and quantity of weeds removed 
- Pulling a weed will randomly produce a powerup
- Powerups are:
	- Faster movement
	- Faster weed-pulling
	- Lawn-mower to clear-cut anything except full-height weeds
		- Weeds that are clear-cut grow back quickly since roots are present
	- Weed-killer kills weeds and roots
	- Flame-thrower can remove one full-height weed but not the root
